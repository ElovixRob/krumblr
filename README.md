# Krumblr

The blog is the quintessential 'Hello World' app for Rails. But who has time to
read a long blog post anymore? Krumblr is a Tumblr-like app which allows users
to post short snippets. The brief for the features is deliberately vague so
that we can see how you interpret the requirements and solve problems
accordingly.

## Core Features

At a minimum the following features should be implemented:

* Users can sign up and create one or more blogs.
* Users can create posts on the blogs.
* Posts can just be text.

## Extra Features

These are additional features which do not have to be implemented (although
we'd like to see at least a couple of them). Feel free to pick and choose from
the following the things you'd like to demonstrate or that might pose an
interesting challenge:

* Comments on posts
* Tags/categories on posts
* Reblogging posts
* Liking posts
* Different post types (images, code snippets, embedded video, etc.)
* Searching the contents of a blog

You can implement as many or as few of these as you'd like. Code quality is
important, so a couple of features implemented well goes a long way.

## Notes

* You're welcome to use gems for various features; we're interested in how you
  solve problems though, so maybe don't use them for everything.
* You're welcome to include a CSS framework (or style it from scratch) to
  you're liking, but again, it's about the approach to problem solving. UI
  is part of that, but it doesn't have to be the main focus.
* Testing is important, so make sure you have appropriate coverage with specs.
* Readable code is good; comments are appreciated where things aren't
  immediately obvious.

## Setup

* Fork this repo.
* Code your app.
* Commit your changes (frequent commits are good).
* Submit a pull request so we can see what you've done.

If you'd like to show us a working app, you could deploy to something like
Heroku, or even include CI using Travis, but don't feel obliged. As long as we
